Welcome!

I am Anita, a student at Codecademy. This project is for an assignment. The project was developed for students to practice JavaScript while they are in the process of completing the program.

The Aim;
To generate friendly reminders for coders to reinforce basic syntaxes, methods, and best practices.

The Objective
For coders to become familiar, recognize basic patterns, and learn to memorize operations that are required to carry out to complete a project successfully.

What does this project do?
This program randomly generates code messages each time the program is run. 

These messages are information about software engineering, used to serve as a reminder for most commonly used syntaxes, share code facts, and important reminders in this field. 

I describe this program as a short-mini guide that keeps you up to date with general programming languages.

What languages and concepts were used to build the program?
This program is made up of three different pieces of data structures.

The languages used are HTML and JavaScript.
