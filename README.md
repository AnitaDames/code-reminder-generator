# Code Reminder Generator

![Screenshot](./images/script.png "JS SCRIPT")

## What does this project do?
This program randomly generates code messages each time the program is run. 

> I am Anita, a student at Codecademy. This project is for an assignment. The project was developed for students to practice JavaScript core concepts while they are in the process of completing the program.

## The Aim
To generate friendly reminders for coders to reinforce basic syntaxes, methods, tips, and best practices.

## The Objective
For coders to become familiar, recognize basic patterns, and learn to memorize operations that are required to complete a project successfully.

These messages are information about software engineering, used to serve as a reminder for most commonly used syntaxes, share code facts, tips, and important reminders in this field. 

I describe this program as a short-mini guide that keeps you up to date with general programming languages.

## Key Concepts

- JavaScripts Syntax
